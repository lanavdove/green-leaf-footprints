## Final Project Analysis
We learned through the project that instead of plainly showing the liter data to inspire others to take action against littering, we would want to show locations on where to dump trash in order to reduce litter instead. This is more of an information solution that can change behavior. We display waste and recylcing centers on an interactive map based upon the users location in order to give users the closest locations to dump their garbage.
