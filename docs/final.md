## Information Problem
To address the environmental habits of Prince George's County through real-life data on current recycling and weekly trash disposal habits
## Stakeholders 
Environmental Health Division and Environmental Education in Prince George’s County

Communities that comprise Prince George’s
## Data
LiterTRAK for Prince George's County
https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/Environment/LitterTRAK/9tsa-iner/data

Waste and recylcing center information

## Technical system decision rationale
Leaflet - good tool for users trying to find trash dumping locations on a map and utilizes javascript

Tableau - has attractive heatmap tool to visualize amount of trash in Prince George's County

---could someone explain why these were utilized over other tools ---

## Final Project Analysis
  We learned through the project that instead of plainly showing the liter data to inspire others to take action against littering, we would want to show locations on where to dump trash in order to reduce litter instead. This is more of an information solution that can change behavior. We display waste and recylcing centers on an interactive map based upon the users location in order to give users the closest locations to dump their garbage.
  
    One of our challenges in our information project was data cleaning. Public data is generally messy and there were data entries that were irrelevant to the type of litter and related information. Columns of data were mislabeled such as Latitude and Longitude being switched. Another challenge was switching direction to solve our information problem. We had to refocus on how we visually were going to represent our problem through graphs and the site layout. With our graphs, we learned that leaflet would not be an ideal tool for heatmaps and decided Tableau would function better.
    
    Some of the next steps to take for our project would be to possibly improve data collection by making data entries more standard and descriptive. More maps on different aspects of the data could be utilized to show different factors of the litering problem. With our leaflet map, we could also introduce a search bar to search for trash drop-off locations by name and location. We could also contact the Environmental Health Division and Environmental Education Department in Prince George's County to give our web application more traction.
