## 4. About Page
The About Page gives a small description about what our organization is, our mission and vission, and what we do. We use current, local data to inform the community of concerning environmental issues. Our vision is to create a better future for our community and planet, and our mission is to lead Prince George's County environmental improvements and foster a sustainable future through environmental awareness, education, and practices. We hope to bring litter awareness to the residents by showing them real-life data on their current recycling and trash habits through a heat map. Environmental awareness is an important aspect of encouraging conservation efforts, and it is important we work together as a community to address this issue. At the bottom of the page, we have three pictures which were taken at the UMD campus to show off our beautiful community. 

## 5. The Project Page
The Project Page briefly introduces our project and the dataset we used. After analysis of the data, we produced a heat map of the litter around the community and an interactive map of places to drop off trash. Most of trash that was reported was through individual and group clean-ups and were a result of illegal dumping of litter and trash. It is important we are aware of this issue and address it accordingly.

## 6. Interactive Heat Map on the Project Page
The heat map of the litter around Prince George's county is interactive, where the user is able to zoom in and out on a partiular area of the county to see if they live somewhere that has a high concentration of illegal trash dumping. Areas of higher concentration are represented in yellow. 

## 7. Interactive Map on the Project Page
Currently, our interactive map has a few points around PGC where someone can drop off trash. Clicking on one of the points results in the name of the place, type of trash they are accepts, and their address. Eventually, we hope to have more points on our map. Future adjustments to the map would result in the ability for a user to filter based on their location, distance from their location, and type of trash they need to get rid of. 

## 8. Documentation Page
Our documentation page highlights the technologies we used to create our application and data visualizations and our acknowledgements. It also disucsses how to go through the website and how to interact with our map and heat map.
